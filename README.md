# Idle-Carbon-Reducer
A lightweight JavaScript solution (just 5KB) that helps websites reduce their carbon footprint by detecting user inactivity and redirecting idle users to a minimal COâ‚‚ page. This project was conceived by Gabriel Dalton to promote sustainability in web design by reducing the energy used when users leave browser tabs open for extended periods.
