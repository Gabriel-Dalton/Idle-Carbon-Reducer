# Idle Carbon Reducer (ICR)

**Idle Carbon Reducer (ICR)** is a lightweight JavaScript solution designed to reduce carbon emissions by detecting user inactivity (AFK) on a webpage and redirecting the user to a minimal-resource page. This reduces server load, bandwidth, and energy consumption, all while keeping the script footprint incredibly small â€” just **352 bytes**!

### Features
- **Incredibly Small Size**: The entire JavaScript file is just **352 bytes** (uncompressed), ensuring minimal impact on page load times.
- **Customizable Idle Time**: Easily customize the idle time after which the user will be redirected.
- **Customizable Redirect URL**: Define the page where idle users will be sent (e.g., a low-resource, carbon-neutral page).
- **Seamless Integration**: Simply add a `<script>` tag to any webpage to activate it.
- **Energy-Efficient**: Helps reduce energy consumption and COâ‚‚ emissions by redirecting idle users to a minimal-impact page.

## How It Works

The **Idle Carbon Reducer (ICR)** monitors user activity such as mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and scrolling. If no activity is detected within the specified idle time (default is 5 minutes), the user will automatically be redirected to a low-carbon page (default: `low-co2-page.html`).

### Why It's Important

Every second a user spends idle on a page unnecessarily consumes server resources and bandwidth. By redirecting users to a lightweight, minimal page when they're inactive, you can reduce the amount of energy consumed by both the server and the user's device, leading to lower COâ‚‚ emissions.

## How to Use

1. **Add the Script to Your Webpage:**

   Simply include the following script in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://yourserver.com/idle-carbon-reducer.js" data-idle-time="10000" data-redirect-url="low-co2-page.html"></script>
   ```

   - The `data-idle-time` attribute defines how long the user can be idle before redirection (in milliseconds).
   - The `data-redirect-url` attribute defines the page where users will be sent when idle (e.g., a low-resource page).

2. **Host a Minimal COâ‚‚ Page**:

   Create a page that uses minimal server resources and bandwidth (e.g., `low-co2-page.html`):

   ```html
   <!-- low-co2-page.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <title>Eco Mode Activated</title>
     <style>
       body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; padding-top: 20%; background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333; }
       a { color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; }
     </style>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>You've Entered Eco Mode ðŸŒ¿</h1>
     <p>We redirected you to reduce COâ‚‚ emissions.</p>
     <a href="javascript:history.back()">Go Back to Previous Page</a>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the **Idle Carbon Reducer** by changing the following attributes in the script tag:

1. **Idle Time** (`data-idle-time`):
   - Specifies how long the user must be inactive before being redirected.
   - Value is in milliseconds.
   - Example: To set a 10-second idle time:
     ```html
     <script src="https://yourserver.com/idle-carbon-reducer.js" data-idle-time="10000"></script>
     ```

2. **Redirect URL** (`data-redirect-url`):
   - Specifies the URL where the user will be redirected after being idle.
   - Example: To redirect to a custom page:
     ```html
     <script src="https://yourserver.com/idle-carbon-reducer.js" data-redirect-url="custom-idle-page.html"></script>
     ```

## Benefits

- **Low Impact on Performance**: At only 352 bytes, this script adds virtually no overhead to your website.
- **Easy to Implement**: No complex setup required â€” just include a single line of JavaScript in your page.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Contributes to reducing energy consumption and COâ‚‚ emissions from idle users.
- **Customizable**: Both the idle time and the redirect page can be easily customized without editing the JavaScript code.
